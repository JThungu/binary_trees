ALX 0x1D C - Binary Trees
Welcome to the ALX 0x1D C - Binary Trees repository! This repository contains the source code and related materials for the Binary Trees project in the ALX Software Engineering program.

Project Description
In this project, we explore the concept of binary trees in the C programming language. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, widely used for various applications like searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation. The project focuses on understanding the basics of binary trees, tree traversal methods, insertion, and deletion operations.

The main goals of this project include:

Understanding the structure of binary trees and their components.
Implementing basic binary tree traversal algorithms: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.
Learning about binary tree insertion and deletion operations.
Applying the learned concepts to solve programming challenges related to binary trees.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

0-binary_tree_node.c: Contains the implementation of a function that creates a new binary tree node.
1-binary_tree_insert_left.c: Implements a function to insert a new node as the left child of a given node.
2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: Implements a function to insert a new node as the right child of a given node.
3-binary_tree_delete.c: Contains a function to delete an entire binary tree.
4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: Implements a function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
5-binary_tree_is_root.c: Implements a function that checks if a given node is the root of a tree.
6-binary_tree_preorder.c: Contains the implementation of a function to traverse a binary tree using the pre-order traversal method.
7-binary_tree_inorder.c: Implements a function to traverse a binary tree using the in-order traversal method.
8-binary_tree_postorder.c: Implements a function to traverse a binary tree using the post-order traversal method.
9-binary_tree_height.c: Contains a function to calculate the height of a binary tree.
10-binary_tree_depth.c: Implements a function to calculate the depth of a given node in a binary tree.
11-binary_tree_size.c: Implements a function to calculate the size (number of nodes) of a binary tree.
12-binary_tree_leaves.c: Contains a function to count the leaves in a binary tree.
13-binary_tree_nodes.c: Implements a function to count the nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
14-binary_tree_balance.c: Implements a function to check the balance factor of a binary tree.
15-binary_tree_is_full.c: Contains a function to check if a binary tree is full (all nodes have 0 or 2 children).
16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c: Implements a function to check if a binary tree is perfect (all interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level).
Each source code file contains the implementation of a specific binary tree-related function.
